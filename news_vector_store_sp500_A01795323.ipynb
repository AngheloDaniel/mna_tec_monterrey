        "\n",
        " 1. **Load and Explore Financial News Data:**\n",
        "    - Load a preprocessed dataset of financial news headlines and summaries related to S&P 500 companies.\n",
        "    - Inspect and structure relevant metadata including publication date, ticker, and provider.\n",
        "\n",
        " 2. **Build a Custom Vector Store:**\n",
        "    - Combine title and summary text for embedding.\n",
        "    - Implement a vector store from scratch with support for semantic search and optional metadata-based filtering using cosine similarity.\n",
        "\n",
        " 3. **Generate and Use Sentence Embeddings:**\n",
        "    - Apply a pre-trained transformer model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to encode text into embeddings for semantic analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        " 4. **Perform Semantic Search with Filtering:**\n",
        "    - Retrieve the most relevant news documents for a given query using both full-dataset and metadata-filtered searches.\n",
        "\n",
        " 5. **Analyze Semantic Search Results:**\n",
        "    - Interpret and visualize results of search queries (e.g., \"AI announcement\").\n",
        "    - Identify temporal patterns and ticker frequency among top-ranked results.\n",
        "\n",
        " 6. **Implement a FAISS-Based Vector Store:**\n",
        "    - Normalize embeddings and use FAISS (IndexFlatIP) to enable efficient similarity search at scale.\n",
        "    - Compare FAISS-based search results with custom vector store results.\n",
        "\n",
        " 7. **Critically Compare Search Systems:**\n",
        "    - Evaluate differences in similarity computation, speed, and scalability between custom and FAISS-based systems.\n",
        "    - Reflect on design trade-offs for real-world vector search systems."

            "DOCUMENT TEXT: How the 10-year yield affects REITs Interest rate-sensitive REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) are set to benefit from the Federal Reserve's anticipated easing of monetary policy. Richard Anderson, Wedbush managing director of equity research for REITs, joins Catalysts to provide insights into this segment of the market. Anderson observes an \"instant gratification\" scenario unfolding in REITs, noting their quick recovery despite the weaker state of the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX). He explains that \"any kind of investment vehicle with an income component like the REITs\" tends to thrive in a declining rate environment. However, he raises questions about the longer-term outlook, wondering, \"What does a better rate environment, a normal sloping yield curve, do to people's attention of the fundamentals of commercial real estate?\" describing this as \"the next leg of opportunity\" for the sector. Anderson points out that uncertainty within the 10-year yield curve affects REITs' ability to deploy capital and grow earnings. He emphasizes, \"The real thing that we're watching is the longer end of the curve. And if we get some certainty there, then it's perhaps off to the races, and perhaps we'll have an outperformance here in 2024 from the REITs.\" Watch the video above to hear what Anderson thinks are the most attractive investment opportunities in REITs.&nbsp; For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.

            "DOCUMENT TEXT: How the 10-year yield affects REITs Interest rate-sensitive REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) are set to benefit from the Federal Reserve's anticipated easing of monetary policy. Richard Anderson, Wedbush managing director of equity research for REITs, joins Catalysts to provide insights into this segment of the market. Anderson observes an \"instant gratification\" scenario unfolding in REITs, noting their quick recovery despite the weaker state of the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX). He explains that \"any kind of investment vehicle with an income component like the REITs\" tends to thrive in a declining rate environment. However, he raises questions about the longer-term outlook, wondering, \"What does a better rate environment, a normal sloping yield curve, do to people's attention of the fundamentals of commercial real estate?\" describing this as \"the next leg of opportunity\" for the sector. Anderson points out that uncertainty within the 10-year yield curve affects REITs' ability to deploy capital and grow earnings. He emphasizes, \"The real thing that we're watching is the longer end of the curve. And if we get some certainty there, then it's perhaps off to the races, and perhaps we'll have an outperformance here in 2024 from the REITs.\" Watch the video above to hear what Anderson thinks are the most attractive investment opportunities in REITs.&nbsp; For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.

Richard Anderson, Wedbush managing director of equity research for REITs, joins Catalysts to provide insights into this segment of the market. Anderson observes an \"instant gratification\" scenario unfolding in REITs, noting their quick recovery despite the weaker state of the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX). He explains that \"any kind of investment vehicle with an income component like the REITs\" tends to thrive in a declining rate environment. However, he raises questions about the longer-term outlook, wondering, \"What does a better rate environment, a normal sloping yield curve, do to people's attention of the fundamentals of commercial real estate?\" describing this as \"the next leg of opportunity\" for the sector. Anderson points out that uncertainty within the 10-year yield curve affects REITs' ability to deploy capital and grow earnings. He emphasizes, \"The real thing that we're watching is the longer end of the curve. And if we get some certainty there, then it's perhaps off to the races, and perhaps we'll have an outperformance here in 2024 from the REITs.\" Watch the video above to hear what Anderson thinks are the most attractive investment opportunities in REITs.&nbsp; For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.

Dimon proposed using the revenue to double income tax credits, even for individuals without children, noting that the estimated $60 billion additional cost from this initiative would directly benefit communities, families and homes.\n",

        "Upon reviewing the results for the query \"Stock price drop\", my first impression is that both MiniLM and mpnet provided accurate outputs. However, MiniLM appears to have a more straightforward interpretation of the news content. For example, in the KR article from Zacks, the phrase “stock drops” is present, but the article itself lacks substantive detail. In contrast, mpnet results, though not always containing the exact keywords, tend to offer richer context, such as the UBER news piece that links the share price decline to fears over Tesla's robotaxi developments, adding relevant causality and investment commentary.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the case of the \"Layoffs\" query, mpnet duplicated its first and second result, and the AVGO article seems only loosely related to the topic. Meanwhile, MiniLM performed significantly better, retrieving articles that strongly align with the theme. This may be attributed to the simplicity of the query itself, MiniLM’s less nuanced semantic processing resulted in clearer matches with minimal ambiguity, yielding stronger overall relevance than mpnet in this instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "After a deep dive into \"Mergers and acquisitions\", I conclude that MiniLM exhibits lower semantic drift. While mpnet returns higher average scores, MiniLM is more direct in identifying core topics. Mpnet, by conducting more layered semantic analysis, may surface connections between themes and queries that are not explicitly stated, offering potentially deeper insights, even though with a greater risk of introducing noise. Notably, MiniLM tends to include the actual query terms within the retrieved texts, indicating a shallower analysis which, depending on the use case, may actually enhance clarity and precision.\n"
