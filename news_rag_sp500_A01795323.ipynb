        "1. **Perform Semantic Search with Metadata Filtering:**\n",
        "   - Query the provided FAISS vector store to retrieve relevant financial news articles based on natural language questions.\n",
        "   - Apply optional filters using metadata such as ticker or publication date to refine search results.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Enrich Data with Company Metadata:**\n",
        "   - Use the `yfinance` library to retrieve company-level metadata (company name, sector, industry) for tickers in the dataset.\n",
        "   - Integrate this metadata to support enhanced filtering and analysis of news data.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline:**\n",
        "   - Combine retrieved news snippets as context to generate answers using OpenAI‚Äôs GPT models.\n",
        "   - Construct effective prompts that guide the language model to provide concise, context-aware responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Evaluate and Analyze RAG Outputs:**\n",
        "   - Review generated answers alongside the supporting news excerpts.\n",
        "   - Reflect on the strengths and limitations of the simple RAG pipeline and consider potential improvements, such as adding more filters or refining retrieval strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Incorporate Financial Metadata into Retrieval Context:**\n",
        "   - Enrich retrieved news snippets with key financial metadata including ticker, company name, sector, and industry.\n",
        "   - Format prompts that combine both text excerpts and metadata to provide richer context to the language model.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Generate Context-Aware Answers Using OpenAI Models:**\n",
        "   - Construct and send prompts to an LLM that leverage both news content and metadata to produce concise, informed financial analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Compare Answers With and Without Metadata:**\n",
        "   - Evaluate the impact of including financial metadata on answer quality using criteria such as clarity, detail, accuracy, and contextual relevance.\n",
        "   - Summarize findings to reflect on the role of metadata in improving retrieval-augmented generation."

On one hand, certain stocks are highlighted for their strong performance, positive catalysts, and favorable price targets set by analysts, suggesting attractive upside potential. However, there is also a prevalent skepticism regarding these forecasts, as analysts may face institutional pressures that can lead to overly optimistic projections. Additionally, the disparity between bullish analyst ratings and the realities of market conditions is evident, leading to warnings about stocks that may not have solid fundamentals, thus suggesting that investors should approach these recommendations with a critical eye. Overall, while there is excitement around certain stocks, the underlying messages emphasize the importance of due diligence and a wary perspective on analyst projections.\n\n### Context:\n3 of Wall Street‚Äôs Favorite Stocks Facing Headwinds : Wall Street has set ambitious price targets for the stocks in this article. While this suggests attractive upside potential, it‚Äôs important to remain skeptical because analysts face institutional pressures that can sometimes lead to overly optimistic forecasts.\n\n3 Hyped Up  Stocks Facing Headwinds : Great things are happening to the stocks in this article. They‚Äôre all outperforming the market over the last month because of positive catalysts such as a new product line, constructive news flow, or even a loyal Reddit fanbase.\n\n1 of Wall Street‚Äôs Favorite Stock with Impressive Fundamentals and 2 to Think Twice About : The stocks in this article have caught Wall Street‚Äôs attention in a big way, with price targets implying returns above 20%. But investors should take these forecasts with a grain of salt because analysts typically say nice things about companies so their firms can win business in other product lines like M&A advisory.\n\n1 Unpopular Stock that Should Get More Attention and 2 to Steer Clear Of : When Wall Street turns bearish on a stock, it‚Äôs worth paying attention. These calls stand out because analysts rarely issue grim ratings on companies for fear their firms will lose out in other business lines such as M&A advisory.\n\n3 of Wall Street‚Äôs Favorite Stocks with Questionable Fundamentals : Wall Street is overwhelmingly bullish on the stocks in this article, with price targets suggesting significant upside potential.

This has caused retail stocks to decline by 13.7% over the past six months, which is notably worse than the S&P 500's decline of 5.5%.\n\n2. **Adaptation to Technological Changes**: Retailers are adapting their business models in response to changing shopping behaviors driven by technology. This adaptation is essential as consumer preferences evolve, but it also contributes to the uncertainty faced by the sector.\n\n3. **Impact of Trade Policies**: Retail executives are dealing with the ramifications of tariffs and trade policies. They have reportedly shifted their supply chains, and many price increases have already been implemented in response to these external pressures.\n\n4. **Economic Cycle Dependency**: The performance of consumer discretionary businesses is closely linked to economic cycles. Recently, these businesses have faced headwinds, with an industry-wide drop of 12.3%, significantly worse than the S&P 500's 2.1% decline.\n\nOverall, the combination of increased operational costs due to tariffs, changing consumer behaviors, and economic uncertainties has created a challenging environment for retailers.\n\n### Context:\n3 Consumer Stocks That Concern Us : Retailers are adapting their business models as technology changes how people shop.

This legislative change poses a significant risk to the economic viability of renewable energy projects, potentially making them uneconomical and prompting a crash in renewable energy stocks.\n\n2. **Price Fluctuations**: The oilfield service sector, represented by companies like SLB, HAL, and BKR, faces challenges due to sliding oil prices. This decline in prices can lead to reduced profitability and budget cuts in drilling operations.\n\n3. **Increase in Tariffs**: Rising tariffs are complicating the operational landscape for energy companies. As tariffs increase, costs related to imports and materials may rise, affecting profit margins and global competitiveness.\n\n4. **Budget Constraints**: With reduced drilling budgets, companies in the oilfield service sector may have to navigate a more challenging financial environment, limiting their operational capacity and future investments.\n\n5. **Market Demand Shifts**: Companies are also grappling with fluctuating demand for traditional energy sources versus renewable energy. As the market evolves, businesses must adapt or risk being left behind.\n\nThese combined factors create a highly uncertain environment for stakeholders in both the renewable energy and oilfield service sectors.\n\n### Context:\nRenewable Energy Stocks Crash as U.S. Advances Bill That Could Decimate the Industry : Congress is pushing forward a bill that could upend the renewable energy industry.

First, there is a notable adaptation of business models by retailers as technology changes consumer shopping behaviors. This shift indicates an ongoing transformation in how products are marketed and sold.\n\nSecond, despite these adaptations, demand within the industry remains volatile, making retailers vulnerable to fluctuations in consumer spending. This uncertainty has been reflected in the overall performance of retail stocks, which have dropped by 13.7% over the past six months, significantly underperforming compared to the S&P 500‚Äôs decline of 5.5%.\n\nAdditionally, retailers are grappling with external factors such as trade tariffs, prompting many to alter their supply chains and implement price increases, which may affect consumer purchasing habits further.

If enacted, this legislation could render many renewable projects uneconomical, jeopardizing the financial viability of companies like NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE) and Enphase Energy, Inc. (ENPH).\n\n2. **Declining Oil Prices and Budget Cuts**: The oilfield services sector, including companies like Halliburton Company (HAL) and Baker Hughes Company (BKR), faces a difficult environment due to sliding oil prices. This decline is compounded by increasing tariffs and shrinking drilling budgets, raising concerns about future profitability and operational sustainability.\n\n3. **Uncertainty from Geopolitical and Trade Conflicts**: The ongoing trade conflict, particularly related to tariffs, adds uncertainty to the market dynamics for companies reliant on critical materials like copper. For instance, Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX) navigates the complexities of tariff implications on the industrial economy, which could affect competitive positioning and operational costs.\n\nOverall, the energy industry is grappling with potential regulatory changes, volatile market conditions, and the impact of global trade policies.\n\n### Enriched Context:\nTicker: NEE\nCompany Name: NextEra Energy, Inc.\nSector: Utilities\nIndustry: Utilities - Regulated Electric\nNews: Renewable Energy Stocks Crash as U.S. Advances Bill That Could Decimate the Industry : Congress is pushing forward a bill that could upend the renewable energy industry.

        "Recent news highlights several risks and challenges facing the energy industry, particularly regarding renewable energy and oilfield services:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Legislative Threats to Renewable Energy Subsidies: The advancement of a bill by the U.S. House of Representatives aims to repeal significant subsidies for the renewable energy sector. If enacted, this legislation could render many renewable projects uneconomical, jeopardizing the financial viability of companies like NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE) and Enphase Energy, Inc. (ENPH).\n",
        "\n",
        "* Declining Oil Prices and Budget Cuts: The oilfield services sector, including companies like Halliburton Company (HAL) and Baker Hughes Company (BKR), faces a difficult environment due to sliding oil prices. This decline is compounded by increasing tariffs and shrinking drilling budgets, raising concerns about future profitability and operational sustainability.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Uncertainty from Geopolitical and Trade Conflicts: The ongoing trade conflict, particularly related to tariffs, adds uncertainty to the market dynamics for companies reliant on critical materials like copper. For instance, Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX) navigates the complexities of tariff implications on the industrial economy, which could affect competitive positioning and operational costs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the energy industry is grappling with potential regulatory changes, volatile market conditions, and the impact of global trade policies.\n",

        "Recent news about the energy industry highlights several key risks and challenges, particularly for the renewable energy sector and oilfield services.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Legislative Changes: The U.S. Congress is advancing a bill that could repeal important subsidies for renewable energy. This legislative change poses a significant risk to the economic viability of renewable energy projects, potentially making them uneconomical and prompting a crash in renewable energy stocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Price Fluctuations: The oilfield service sector, represented by companies like SLB, HAL, and BKR, faces challenges due to sliding oil prices. This decline in prices can lead to reduced profitability and budget cuts in drilling operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Increase in Tariffs: Rising tariffs are complicating the operational landscape for energy companies. As tariffs increase, costs related to imports and materials may rise, affecting profit margins and global competitiveness.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Budget Constraints: With reduced drilling budgets, companies in the oilfield service sector may have to navigate a more challenging financial environment, limiting their operational capacity and future investments.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Market Demand Shifts: Companies are also grappling with fluctuating demand for traditional energy sources versus renewable energy. As the market evolves, businesses must adapt or risk being left behind.\n",
        "\n",
        "These combined factors create a highly uncertain environment for stakeholders in both the renewable energy and oilfield service sectors.\n",
